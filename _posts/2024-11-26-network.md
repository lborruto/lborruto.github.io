# **üåê Building a Robust Network for Our New Italy Office: From Concept to Completion**

---

Expanding to a new office location is an exciting milestone, but it also comes with the critical responsibility of establishing a secure and efficient network infrastructure. Recently, I had the opportunity to lead the complete network installation for Agicap's new office in Italy. This project encompassed everything from initial planning to the seamless integration of advanced networking components. Here's a glimpse into why we undertook this endeavor, how we executed it, and the impressive outcomes we've achieved.

## **üßê Why a New Network?**

As Agicap continues to grow, establishing a reliable and secure network in our new Italy office was essential to support our expanding team and operations. The primary goals were to ensure:

- **üîí Security:** Protect sensitive company data and maintain compliance with industry standards.
- **üìà Scalability:** Accommodate future growth without frequent overhauls.
- **‚ö° Performance:** Provide fast and stable connections for both wired and wireless devices.
- **üõ†Ô∏è Manageability:** Simplify network administration and monitoring for our IT team.

Achieving these objectives required a thoughtful approach to network design, leveraging cutting-edge technology to create a foundation that supports our business needs today and tomorrow.

## **üîß Crafting the Solution: How It Was Done**

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Establishing a Secure Foundation with Fortinet Firewall**
Security is the cornerstone of any robust network. We deployed a **Fortinet 100F Firewall**, configured with VLAN 5 dedicated to management. This firewall acts as the gatekeeper, controlling traffic between our internal network and the external internet. By segmenting the network into VLANs, we ensured that sensitive management traffic remains isolated and protected from potential threats.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Seamless Connectivity with Meraki Switching**
To manage internal communications efficiently, we integrated a **Meraki Switch (VLAN 10)** into the network. This switch facilitates high-speed connections across the office, handling everything from data transfers to device management. Its intuitive interface allows for easy monitoring and configuration, ensuring that our network remains optimized for performance and reliability.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Comprehensive Wireless Coverage with Meraki Access Points**
Providing robust wireless connectivity was paramount for accommodating our diverse range of devices. We installed multiple **Meraki WiFi Hotspots (VLAN 10)** strategically throughout the office to ensure seamless coverage. These access points support various SSIDs tailored to different user groups, including:

- **üñ•Ô∏è AGC-USERS (VLAN 20):** For employees accessing internal resources.
- **üì± AGC-MOBILE (VLAN 40):** For mobile devices requiring secure connections.
- **üë• GUEST (VLAN 60):** For visitors needing internet access without compromising internal security.

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Efficient Device Management and Segmentation with VLANs**
Network segmentation through VLANs was instrumental in maintaining organization and security:

- **VLAN 5 (MGMT-Firewall):** Manages firewall configurations and network administration.
- **VLAN 10 (MGMT-Meraki):** Oversees Meraki switch operations and device management.
- **VLAN 20 (USERS):** Dedicated to employee desktops and internal applications.
- **VLAN 40 (MOBILE):** Supports mobile devices, ensuring they operate within secure parameters.
- **VLAN 60 (GUEST):** Provides isolated internet access for guests.
- **VLAN 91 (PRINTER):** Connects network printers, segregating them from other traffic for enhanced security.

This segmentation not only enhances security by limiting access based on roles but also optimizes network performance by reducing congestion and managing traffic efficiently.

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Reliable Internet Connectivity with Radbox (COLT)**
Ensuring a stable and high-speed internet connection was achieved by integrating a **Radbox (COLT)** with a dedicated uplink. This setup provides the necessary bandwidth and reliability to support our operations, enabling smooth communication and data transfer across the office.

## **üìä How It‚Äôs Working: The Results**

The successful installation of the network in our new Italy office has brought numerous benefits:

- **üîí Enhanced Security:** With robust firewall protection and VLAN segmentation, our network is well-defended against external threats and internal vulnerabilities.
- **üìà Scalability:** The modular design allows us to effortlessly add more devices and expand the network as our team grows.
- **‚ö° Improved Performance:** High-speed switches and strategically placed access points ensure that all employees enjoy fast and reliable connectivity.
- **üõ†Ô∏è Simplified Management:** Advanced tools and centralized management systems make monitoring and maintaining the network straightforward for our IT team.
- **üòä User Satisfaction:** Employees experience seamless connectivity across wired and wireless devices, boosting productivity and satisfaction.

## **üèÅ Conclusion**

Building the network for Agicap's new Italy office was a rewarding project that underscored the importance of strategic planning and the integration of advanced technologies. By prioritizing security, scalability, and performance, we established a network infrastructure that not only meets our current needs but is also poised to support future growth. This initiative has reinforced our commitment to providing a secure and efficient work environment for our team, ensuring that Agicap continues to thrive in its expanding global presence.
