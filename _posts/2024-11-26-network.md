Expanding to a new office location is an exciting milestone, but it also comes with the critical responsibility of establishing a secure and efficient network infrastructure. Recently, I had the opportunity to lead the complete network installation for Agicap's new office in Italy. This project encompassed everything from initial planning to the seamless integration of advanced networking components. Here's a glimpse into why we undertook this endeavor, how we executed it, and the impressive outcomes we've achieved.

## **üßê Why a New Network?**

As Agicap continues to grow, establishing a reliable and secure network in our new Italy office was essential to support our expanding team and operations. The primary goals were to ensure:

- **Security:** Protect sensitive company data and maintain compliance with industry standards.
- **Scalability:** Accommodate future growth without frequent overhauls.
- **Performance:** Provide fast and stable connections for both wired and wireless devices.
- **Manageability:** Simplify network administration and monitoring for our IT team.

Achieving these objectives required a thoughtful approach to network design, leveraging cutting-edge technology to create a foundation that supports our business needs today and tomorrow.

## **üîß Crafting the Solution: How It Was Done**

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Establishing a Secure Foundation with Fortinet Firewall**
Security is the cornerstone of any robust network. We deployed a **Fortinet 100F Firewall**: this firewall acts as the gatekeeper, controlling traffic between our internal network and the external internet. By segmenting the network into VLANs, we ensured that sensitive management traffic remains isolated and protected from potential threats.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Seamless Connectivity with Meraki Switching**
To manage internal communications efficiently, we integrated a **Cisco Meraki Switch** into the network. This switch facilitates high-speed connections across the office, handling everything from data transfers to device management.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Comprehensive Wireless Coverage with Meraki Access Points**
Providing robust wireless connectivity was paramount for accommodating our diverse range of devices. We installed multiple **Meraki WiFi Hotspots** strategically throughout the office to ensure seamless coverage. These access points support various SSIDs tailored to different user groups, including:

- **USERS:** For employees accessing internal resources.
- **MOBILE:** For mobile devices requiring secure connections.
- **GUEST:** For visitors needing internet access without compromising internal security.

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Efficient Device Management and Segmentation with VLANs**
Network segmentation through VLANs was instrumental in maintaining organization and security:
This segmentation not only enhances security by limiting access based on roles but also optimizes network performance by reducing congestion and managing traffic efficiently.
