# Enhancing WiFi Security with EAP-TLS: A Journey to a Robust Authentication System

In an era where cybersecurity is paramount, ensuring secure wireless connectivity is essential for any organization. I recently embarked on a project to implement EAP-TLS (Extensible Authentication Protocol - Transport Layer Security) for our WiFi network, aiming to bolster security and streamline user access. This blog post delves into the motivations behind this initiative, the approach I took, and the successful outcomes we've achieved.

## **Why EAP-TLS?**

Traditional WiFi security measures, while effective to an extent, often fall short against sophisticated threats. Password-based authentication can be vulnerable to breaches, phishing, and unauthorized access. EAP-TLS offers a more secure alternative by leveraging digital certificates, ensuring that only authenticated devices can connect to the network. This method not only enhances security but also provides a seamless user experience, reducing the reliance on cumbersome password management.

## **The Vision: A Secure and Scalable WiFi Solution**

Our goal was to create a WiFi authentication system that is both highly secure and scalable to accommodate our expanding operations across different regions. By integrating technologies like Active Directory Certificate Services (ADCS), FreeRADIUS, Meraki, Microsoft Intune, and leveraging Azure's robust infrastructure, we aimed to build a solution that is resilient, manageable, and future-proof.

## **Crafting the Solution: How It Was Done**

### **Establishing a Strong Foundation with ADCS**

The backbone of our EAP-TLS setup is a reliable Certificate Authority (CA). Utilizing Active Directory Domain Services, I set up an Enterprise Root CA named `Agicap-CA`. This CA is responsible for issuing and managing digital certificates, ensuring that every device connecting to our network is authenticated and trusted.

### **Seamless Certificate Management with SCEP**

To streamline the issuance and renewal of certificates, I implemented the Simple Certificate Enrollment Protocol (SCEP). This integration allows for automated certificate management across various devices, reducing manual intervention and minimizing the risk of certificate-related issues.

### **Robust Authentication with FreeRADIUS**

FreeRADIUS serves as the heart of our authentication mechanism. Deployed on Debian servers, it handles EAP-TLS requests, ensuring that only devices with valid certificates can access the network. By configuring FreeRADIUS to trust our `Agicap-CA`, we established a secure and efficient authentication process.

### **Integrating with Meraki for Network Management**

Meraki's intuitive dashboard played a crucial role in managing our WiFi network. By uploading the `Agicap-CA` certificate and configuring the AGC-RADIUS SSID, we ensured that our access points communicate securely with the FreeRADIUS servers. This integration guarantees that only authenticated devices can connect, maintaining the integrity of our network.

### **Centralized Device Management with Microsoft Intune**

Microsoft Intune was instrumental in distributing the root certificates and WiFi profiles across various devices, including Windows, MacOS, iOS, and Android. By creating Trusted Root and SCEP profiles, devices automatically obtain the necessary certificates, simplifying the onboarding process and ensuring consistent security standards across all platforms.

### **Deploying with Azure and Terraform for High Availability**

To ensure our solution is both scalable and highly available, I deployed the entire setup on Azure, covering our operations in France and Italy. Using Terraform for infrastructure as code, I provisioned FreeRADIUS servers behind a load balancer. This approach not only streamlined the deployment process but also facilitated easy updates and maintenance, ensuring our network remains robust and resilient.

## **How It’s Working: The Results**

The implementation of EAP-TLS has significantly enhanced our WiFi security posture. Here’s how:

- **Enhanced Security:** By relying on digital certificates, we've mitigated the risks associated with password-based authentication. Only devices with valid certificates can access the network, reducing the likelihood of unauthorized access.
  
- **Seamless User Experience:** Users no longer need to manage complex passwords. The automated certificate management ensures that device authentication is smooth and hassle-free.
  
- **Scalability and Reliability:** Deploying on Azure with Terraform has provided us with a scalable and reliable infrastructure. The load-balanced FreeRADIUS servers ensure high availability, catering to our growing user base without compromising performance.
  
- **Centralized Management:** Microsoft Intune allows for centralized distribution and management of certificates and WiFi profiles, ensuring consistency and simplifying administrative tasks across multiple platforms.

## **Conclusion**

Implementing EAP-TLS for our WiFi network was a strategic move to enhance security, streamline user access, and ensure scalability. By integrating ADCS, FreeRADIUS, Meraki, Intune, and leveraging Azure's infrastructure, we established a robust and secure authentication system that meets our organizational needs. This project not only fortified our network security but also showcased the power of combining various technologies to create a cohesive and efficient solution.
