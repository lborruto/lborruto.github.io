# **🔒 Enhancing WiFi Security with EAP-TLS**

---

## **Introduction**

In today's cybersecurity landscape, ensuring secure and seamless wireless connectivity is no longer optional—it's essential. To address emerging threats and streamline user access, I recently implemented **EAP-TLS (Extensible Authentication Protocol - Transport Layer Security)** for our organization's WiFi network.

This post covers the motivations behind this initiative, the technical approach, and the successful outcomes achieved.

## **🚀 Why Choose EAP-TLS?**

Traditional WiFi security measures, such as password-based authentication, often fall short against advanced threats like phishing or brute force attacks. **EAP-TLS**, by leveraging digital certificates, ensures that only authorized devices can connect to the network.

### 🔑 Benefits of EAP-TLS:
- **Stronger Security**: Certificates replace passwords, mitigating risks associated with weak or stolen credentials.
- **Improved User Experience**: No need for users to manage complex passwords—authentication is seamless.
- **Scalability**: Ideal for large organizations with diverse devices and users.

## **🌐 Our Vision: A Secure and Scalable WiFi Network**

The goal was to create a WiFi authentication system that:
1. **Provides robust security** through digital certificates.
2. **Scales effectively** to meet the demands of a growing user base across multiple regions.
3. **Simplifies management** for administrators through centralized tools.

To achieve this, we integrated:
- **Active Directory Certificate Services (ADCS)**
- **FreeRADIUS**
- **Meraki**
- **Microsoft Intune**
- **Azure Infrastructure**

## **⚙️ Crafting the Solution**

### **1. Building the Foundation with ADCS**
The backbone of our solution was a Certificate Authority (CA). Using **Active Directory Certificate Services (ADCS)**, we set up an enterprise root CA named `Agicap-CA`. This CA handles certificate issuance, ensuring only authenticated devices can access the network.

### **2. Automating Certificate Management with SCEP**
To simplify certificate distribution, we implemented **Simple Certificate Enrollment Protocol (SCEP)**. SCEP automates certificate issuance and renewal, reducing manual effort and minimizing errors.

### **3. 🔐 Secure Authentication with FreeRADIUS**
**FreeRADIUS**, deployed on Debian servers, acts as the authentication server. Configured to trust `Agicap-CA`, FreeRADIUS ensures that only devices with valid certificates can access the WiFi network.

### **4. 📡 Network Management with Meraki**
Using Meraki's dashboard, we uploaded the root CA certificate (`Agicap-CA`) and configured the SSID to interact securely with FreeRADIUS servers. This guarantees that only authenticated devices connect to our network.

### **5. 📱 Centralized Device Management with Intune**
With **Microsoft Intune**, we distributed root certificates and WiFi profiles across:
- **Windows**
- **macOS**
- **iOS**
- **Android**

This approach ensures consistent security policies and seamless onboarding for users.

### **6. 🌩️ Deploying on Azure with Terraform**
For scalability and high availability, we deployed FreeRADIUS servers on **Azure** using **Terraform**. Load balancers ensure reliability, while infrastructure as code simplifies updates and scaling across regions.

## **📈 Results: A Robust WiFi Network**

The implementation of EAP-TLS delivered measurable improvements:

1. **Enhanced Security**:
   Digital certificates eliminate password vulnerabilities, ensuring only authorized devices connect.

2. **Seamless User Experience**:
   Automated certificate management eliminates the need for complex passwords, improving convenience for users.

3. **Scalability and Reliability**:
   Azure-hosted FreeRADIUS servers provide a scalable, resilient infrastructure capable of supporting our growing user base.

4. **Simplified Administration**:
   Microsoft Intune enables centralized certificate and profile management, reducing the administrative burden.

## **🏁 Conclusion**

Implementing EAP-TLS for our WiFi network was a strategic move that significantly improved our security posture and user experience. By leveraging tools like ADCS, FreeRADIUS, Meraki, Intune, and Azure, we built a system that is both secure and scalable.
